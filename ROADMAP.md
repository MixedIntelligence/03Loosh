# 🛣️ Loosh Stack Roadmap | Plasma MXI (03Loosh)

## 🎯 Objective

Develop an emotional intelligence and well-being infrastructure that allows systems to detect, respond to, and harmonize with human and somatic states.

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Emotional Classification + Logging

- [x] Emotion detection using a pre-trained transformer model
- [x] Logging emotional state, confidence, and timestamp to CSV
- [x] Basic real-time emotional dashboard
- [ ] Jupyter notebook for exploratory emotion tracking

---

## 🔁 Phase 1: Contextual Awareness & Symbolic Layer

- [ ] Link emotional states to care recommendations
- [ ] Train symbolic model for metaphoric/emergent input (dreams, drawings)
- [ ] Connect to other Stacks (Souls for emotion-reactive robots, Kybalion for learning rituals)

---

## 🌱 Phase 2: Bio-Signal & Multimodal Integration

- [ ] Incorporate voice tone, facial micro-expressions, HRV/GSR input
- [ ] Live biofeedback → adaptive UI response
- [ ] Ritual interface for emotional restoration + guidance

---

## 🤝 Contribute

Looking for:
- Clinical psychologists & affective computing researchers  
- Somatic therapists & embodiment-focused UX designers  
- Devs comfortable with biosensor data & soft interface logic  
- Artists and philosophers who design with emotion in mind

Let’s build care systems worthy of human emotion.
